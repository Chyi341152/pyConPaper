Asynchronous code 异步编程
===================
    The simplest definition of Async...
        - "A style of concurrent programming"
        async IO that's not the only way to do a thing

    How Does Python Do Multiple Things At Once?
        - Multiple Processes
            The OS does all the multi-tasking work
            Only option for multi-core concurrency
        - Multiple Threads
            The OS does all the multi-tasking work
            In CPython, the GIL prevents multi-core concurrency
        - Asynchronous Programming
            No OS intervention
            One process, one thread


    A practical definition of Async...
        "A style of concurrent programming in which tasks release the CPU during waiting periods, so that other tasks can use it."

    How is Async Implemented?
        Suspend and Resume:
            Async functions need the ability to suspend and resume
            A function that enters a waiting period is suspended, and only resumed when the wait is over

            Four ways to implement suspend/resume in Python
                - Callback functions
                - Generator functions
                - Async/wait (Python 3.5+)
                - Greenlets (requires greenlet package)
