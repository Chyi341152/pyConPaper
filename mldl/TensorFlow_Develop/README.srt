        {Introduction to Machine Learning}
            What you learn here will allow you, as a software engineer, to do three things better.
                1. First, it gives you a tool to reduce the time you spend programming.
                2. Second, It will allow you to customize your products, making them better for specific groups of people.
                3. Third, Machine learning lets you solve problems that you, as programmer, have no idea how to do by hand.

        {Rules of Machine Learning}
            1. Make sure your pipeline is solid end to end
            2. Start with a reasonable objective
            3. Add common-sense features in a simple way
            4. Make sure that your pipeline stays solid

            Rule #1: Don't be afraid to launch a product without machine learning
            Rule #2: First, design and implement metrics
            Rule #3: Choose machine learning over a complex heuristic



Terminology
===========
    Instance        : The thing about which you want to make a prediction.
    Label           : An answer for a prediction task either the answer produced by a machine learning system
                        or the right answer supplied in training data.
    Feature         : A property of an instance ysed in a prediction tasks
    Feature Column  : A set of related features
    Example         : An instance (with its features) and a label
    Model           : A statistical representation of a prediction task.
    Metric          : A number that you care about
    Objective       : A metric that your algorithm is trying to optimize.
    Pipeline        : The infrastructure surrounding a machine learning algorithm.
