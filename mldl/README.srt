Machining Learning
==================
    Chapter I. The Machine Learning Landscape
        Macine Learning is the science (and art) of programming computers so they can learn from data/

        Types of Macine Learning Systems:
            1. Supervised Learning
                In supervised learning, the training data you feed to the algorithm includes the desired solutions called label.
                [the most important supervised learning algorithms]
                    k-Nearest Neighnors
                    Linear Regression
                    Logistic Regression
                    Support Vector Machines
                    Decision Trees and Random Forests
                    Neural networks
            2. Unsupervised Learning
                In unsuprtvised learning, the training data is unlabeled,The system tries to learn without a teacher
                [the most important unsupervised learning algorithms]
                    Clustering:
                        k-Means
                        Hierarchical Cluster Analysis(HCA) 层次聚类分析
                        Expectation Maximization
                    Visualization and dimensionality reduction
                        Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
                        Kernel PCA
                        Locally-Linear Embedding (LLE)
                        t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
                    Association rule learning
                        Apriori
                        Eclat
            3. Reinforcement Learning

RabbitMQ
========
    A producer is a user application that sends message.
    A queue is a buffer that stores messages
    A consumer is a user application that receives messages

    Exchange: is a very simple thing. On one side it receives messages from producers and the other side it pushes them to queues. The exchange
        Must know exactly what to do with a message it receives. Should it be appended to a particular queue? Should it be appended to many queue?
        Or should it get discarded. The rule for that are defined by the exchange type.

        1. direct
        2. topic
        3. headers
        4. fanout -- it just broadcasts all the messages it receives to all the queues it knows.

    sudo rabbitmqctl list_exchanges # to list the exchanges on the server
