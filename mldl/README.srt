Machining Learning
==================
    Chapter I. The Machine Learning Landscape
        Macine Learning is the science (and art) of programming computers so they can learn from data/

        Types of Macine Learning Systems:
            1. Supervised Learning
                In supervised learning, the training data you feed to the algorithm includes the desired solutions called label.
                [the most important supervised learning algorithms]
                    k-Nearest Neighnors
                    Linear Regression
                    Logistic Regression
                    Support Vector Machines
                    Decision Trees and Random Forests
                    Neural networks
            2. Unsupervised Learning
                In unsuprtvised learning, the training data is unlabeled,The system tries to learn without a teacher

                    Clustering:
                        k-Means
                        Hierarchical Cluster Analysis(HCA) 层次聚类分析
                        Expectation Maximization
                    Visualization and dimensionality reduction
                        Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
                        Kernel PCA
                        Locally-Linear Embedding (LLE)
                        t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
                    Association rule learning
