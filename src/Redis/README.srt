Redis Introduction
==================
    NoSQL don't provide ACID:
        atomicity
        consistency
        isolation
        durability
    NoSQL databases such as Redis are fast, scale easily, and are a great fit for many modern problems.
    But as with everything else, it is important to always choose the right tool for the job.

    Once you've weighted all the options, picking between SQL(for stable, predictable, relational data)
    and NoSQL (for temporary, highly dynamic data) should be an easy task.

    MongoDB: is a feature-heavy document database that allows you to perform range queries, regular expression searches,
    index-ing, and MapReduce.

    Redis is extremely fast, making it perfectly suited for applications that are write-heavy, data that change often,
    and data that naturally fits one of redis data structures.
